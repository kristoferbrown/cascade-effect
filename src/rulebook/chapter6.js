              The Sublimation Style contains the entanglements Blink, Deep Traversal, Nonlocality, Storage, Sublime
              Body, and Sublime Combat.
            </p>
            <p>
              These entanglements are focused on "subliming" the body into hidden space, rendering it invisible and
              intangible. With them you can safely force your being into hidden space, where you will experience a
              parallel realm that mirrors normal space. If you have ranks in any of these entanglements you can induce
              the Sublimate Self non-combat cascade event.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sublimate Self: This event has a difficulty of 3 and takes a minute to induce, after which it causes you
              to enter hidden space. While in hidden space you cannot interact with or be sensed by anything in physical
              space, however the physical world casts shadows into the hidden world that impede your movement. You can
              pass through the shadow of any object that has moved within a number of minutes equal to the sum of your
              ranks in the Sublimation Style. Anything that has been stationary for longer blocks your movement.
            </p>
            <p>
              In hidden space, your senses do not operate normally, rendering you blind and deaf. Instead, you have an
              omnidirectional sensation of the rough shape of unmoving objects within a meter that can detect the motion
              and position of anything within a meter of you. If you have special senses from other entanglements, such
              as Chromaception, Detect Sensorium, Exoproprioception, Sense Waveform, or Tactical Awareness, you keep
              these senses while sublimed.

            <p>
              When entering hidden space, you leave your unconscious physical body behind in the physical world and
              traverse the world with only your hidden body. To exit the hidden space, you must return to your body and
              spend a minute concentrating.

              These Entanglements are focused on protecting yourself and others with wards and barriers that prevent
              forces from propagating through an area. If you have ranks anywhere in this style you can induce the
              Create Ward cascade event.
            </p>

              Create Ward: This event creates a translucent barrier. The durability, size, and duration of these
              barriers are all equal to the amount of Progress used to induce this event plus the sum of your ranks in
              the Abjuration style. Durability indicates the number of points of threat the barrier can absorb before it
              is destroyed, size indicates the maximum width and height in meters your barriers can be, and duration
              indicates the maximum number of rounds they last for if they are not destroyed or dismissed by you as a
              free action.
            </p>
            <p>
              Barriers you create appear on a straight line of your choosing starting from any adjacent space. If this
              line crosses any occupied spaces, you choose which side of the barrier each occupier is on.
            </p>
            <p>
              Barriers cannot be crossed by anything and provide full cover until they are destroyed, their duration
              expires, or you dismiss them. Any attack targeting the barrier or blocked by the barrier reduces its
              current durability by the amount of threat dealt. An attack that reduces durability to 0 destroys the
              barrier but deals no further threat to anything behind it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Barriers block things in hidden space as well as physical objects. However, characters with a sum of ranks
              in the Sublimation style that exceed the current durability of the barrier can phase through it while in
              hidden space.
            </p>
            <p>
              The appearance of barriers varies with the individual creating them, and you do have a degree of control
              over the cosmetic appearance of each one you create. However, unless you have ranks in Filter, your
              barriers are always transparent enough not to hinder vision but still easily visible due to a faint color
              or luminosity.

                    When using the Create Ward event you may add filtering properties to the barrier you create. These
                    filters cannot be used to cause damage; for example, if a blocked object is inside an object that
                    can pass, then both objects are blocked.

                    <p>
                      When creating a barrier, you can target it to a single individual object or entity. The target is
                      either the only thing the barrier blocks, or the only thing that the barrier allows to pass.
                      Things that can pass through the barrier can only do so while moving at speeds slower than 1 space
                      per round. You may add an additional target for each point of Progress you remove from that used
                      to induce the event.

                    When creating a barrier, you can target it to a specific class of objects, a specific type of
                    entity, or a specific homogeneous substance. For example, you could make selections such as metallic
                    objects, humans, or oxygen. Things allowed through the filter can pass through it at any speed. You
                    may add an additional type of target for each point of Progress you remove from that used to induce
                    the event.

                      aware of anything that comes within a space of the barrier no matter where you are, and if it is
                      about to pass through you can choose whether to allow it or block it. If it returns a second time
                      you can change your previous choice. Creating invisible barriers with this property can allow you
                      discreetly monitor an area or set up one way traps.

                      this bio-filter, unwilling to undergo its effects, or moving faster than 1 space per round cannot

                      any unattended non-living material you touch. Each point of progress used to induce this event can
                      affect an amount of material equal to a sphere with a diameter of 10 centimeters. The maximum
                      amount of points you can spend this way is 1 per rank you have in the Chromodynamism style.

                      Create Condensate: Over the course of 8 hours you slowly accrete a small amount of color glass
                      condensate, a type of solid quark matter. This material is not composed of atoms, but rather it is
                      a single macroscopic hadron, a dense mass of many quarks bound together by the strong nuclear

                    monofilament per point of progress created instead of a solid cubic centimeter. Monofilament color
                    glass is almost invisibly fine and if held taut can cut through almost anything. A trap made of
                    tightly stretched monofilament could easily sever the limbs of someone attempting to run through it.
                    Making wire thin enough to gain this cutting property makes it too thin to remain indestructible,
                    and therefore it will break and become useless after being used to cut something once.

                      High degrees of success over your target can make this feeling extremely intense or evoke feelings
                      that radically differ from the target's current state.

                      Control: You seize control over simple nervous systems. At this rank, this event can only affect
                      animals with no hidden body, meaning all invertebrates and jawless fish. For the rest of the
                      scene, you can completely control all qualifying animals in a range of meters equal to the
                      Progress used to induce this event.

                    Your Suggest events can instill a suggestion in the target that they will have a hard time
                    resisting. Tying the target's reaction may only allow simple suggestions that they will not put much
                    effort into, while greatly beating the target may allow you to issue complex commands and orders
                    that the target is irresistibly compelled to follow. The more these suggestions differ from the
                    target's desires, the more successes you'll need to beat them by.

                      Your Suggest events can implant false memories into the target. The more complex and implausible
                      these memories are, the more you'll need to beat their reaction by. Just tying it may only lead to
                      instilling them with a vague deja vu, while beating them by several points may allow you to
                      rewrite a short phase of their life.

                    <p>Additionally, your Control events can affect all non-humanoid animals.</p>

                      At all times, you can sense the presence of any humanoid minds within a number of meters equal to
                      the sum of your ranks in Telesthesia styles, even if they are in hidden space
                    </p>
                    <p>Additionally, you can induce the non-combat cascade event Read Mind.</p>
                    <p>
                      Read Mind: Choose a target you can see. The target can use a reaction to resist this. If you beat
                      their reaction you gain some insight into their mind.

                    <p>
                      At this rank, if you beat the target's reaction, you become aware of their vague state of mind,
                      general emotional state, and stress level for the rest of the scene.

                    If you successfully affect a target with a Read Mind event, you become aware of the target's entire
                    internal monologue for the rest of the scene.

                    If you successfully affect a target with a Read Mind event, you can read some of their memories. The
                    more you beat the target, the deeper the memories you can access. Recent memories are easy to access
                    even on a tie, older memories require them to fail by at least 2, and a deep dark secret by at least
                    4.
