The GM presents a situation, and the players\n          say what their characters are doing. Most of the time, anything a player describes their character doing just\n          happens. However, if the action described is difficult for the character in some way, the GM will assign it a\n          <Crosslink target={topics.DIFFICULTY}>Difficulty</Crosslink> number and you will resolve a Challenge. The\n          basic details of resolving a challenge are presented here, for more details see chapter 3.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          To determine if you succeed, and at what cost, you must use your character's\n          <Crosslink target={topics.METABOLISM}>Metabolisms</Crosslink>\n          to attempt to beat the <Crosslink target={topics.DIFFICULTY}>Difficulty</Crosslink> number. For every\n          <Crosslink target={topics.CHALLENGE}>Challenge</Crosslink>, choose a pairing of one\n          <Crosslink target={topics.PHYS_METAB}>Physical Metabolism</Crosslink> and one\n          <Crosslink target={topics.HIDDEN_METAB}>Hidden Metabolism</Crosslink> that you will use to attempt to overcome\n          the\n          <Crosslink target={topics.DIFFICULTY}>Difficulty</Crosslink>.\n        </p>\n        <Section header=\"Comparing Difficulty\">\n          <p>\n            Often it is very simple to determine if you succeed. Add up the sum of the current values of your chosen\n            Metabolism pairing, this number is referred to as your Progress. If your Progress meets or exceeds the\n            Difficulty number then you complete the Challenge successfully.\n          </p>\n        </Section>\n        <Section header=\"Effort & Metabolisms\">\n          <p>\n            Many <Crosslink target={topics.CHALLENGE}>Challenges</Crosslink> will have a set Effort value representing\n            how much physical or mental effort the Challenge requires. Some Effort values will require you to spend\n            Metabolism points. You spend these points by reducing the Current value of one or both of the involved\n            Metabolisms. These spent points can't be used again until they are regained, for example, by resting.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            When you spend Metabolism points, the amount of Progress created is equal to the number of points spent\n            instead of the sum of the current values.\n          </p>\n        </Section>\n        <Section header=\"Risk & Rolling Dice\">\n          <p>\n            Many <Crosslink target={topics.CHALLENGE}>Challenges</Crosslink> will have a set Risk value representing how\n            much chance, unpredictability, and things out of your character's control can influence the challenge.\n            Certain Risk values will require you to roll dice instead of just counting how successful you are.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            When a Challenge requires dice, the number of dice you roll is typically equal to how much Progress you\n            would have had without the dice. For example, if you would have gotten 4 Progress, instead roll 4 dice. Each\n            die you roll is a 6 sided die that has a roughly 50% chance of generating Progress.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Each die you roll that lands on 4 or above adds a point of\n            <Crosslink target={topics.PROGRESS}>Progress</Crosslink> to the results. Any die that comes up 6 gets\n            rerolled, potentially adding even more <Crosslink target={topics.PROGRESS}>Progress</Crosslink>, or even\n            coming up as 6 to reroll again. Sum up the total amount of\n            <Crosslink target={topics.PROGRESS}>Progress</Crosslink> generated by the dice and if it meets or exceeds\n            the\n            <Crosslink target={topics.DIFFICULTY}>Difficulty</Crosslink>, then you succeed.\n          </p>\n        </Section>\n      </Section>\n\n      <Section header=\"Getting Started\">\n        <p>\n          As a group, you'll have to decide what point to start your story at.

Action Bonuses better represent combat proven abilities. If you wish to play a character\n              who is already capable in combat, you may omit one of your Traits and instead increase an Action Bonus of\n              your choice from 0 to 1.

However, there also are a few cases\n            later when you might further edit your character. This can occur during your story's Inciting Incident, any\n            time you want to revise one of your Traits, and later as you gain and spend experience to level up your\n            character.\n          </p>\n          <Section header=\"The Inciting Incident\">\n            <p>\n              Normal humans typically do not have points in the\n              <Crosslink target={topics.HIDDEN_METAB}>Hidden Metabolisms</Crosslink> and starting characters are similar\n              with only a single point in one of them.

Each\n          Entanglement is associated with one cascade event its action bonus. You can only induce a cascade event if\n          your action bonus for it is above 0. The action bonus will be used to determine the maximum effectiveness of\n          the event.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Unless otherwise specified in the event’s description, inducing a cascade event is a full action and any\n          Challenges involved are default effort and low risk. Focus plus the Hidden Metabolism associated with the\n          event are required in any Challenges.\n        </p>\n        <Section header=\"Event Metrics\">\n          <p>\n            The amount of Progress needed to induce an event, and the strength of the event, are described by metrics.\n            Any Progress created when inducing the event is spent to increase these metrics. Each metric can be\n            increased by up to a maximum number of points equal to your Action Bonus for this event. For example, if\n            your action bonus for an event is 3 and the event has two different metrics, you could increase either\n            metric from 0 to 1, 2 or 3. If you increase both to 3 that typically would require 6 Progress to do.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Most metrics are a basic single unit. This unit indicates both how much the metric increases per point of\n            Progress you spend on it and also the minimum that occurs if you spend 0 Progress on it. For example, an\n            event with the metric “Duration: 1 minute” starts with a minimum duration of 1 minute when you spend 0\n            Progress on it, and increases by 1 minute for each point of Progress spent on it.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Some metrics indicate that they cost more than 1 point of Progress to increase them once. For example, the\n            metric “Targets: 1 person per 3” indicates that the event targets 1 person and can be increased to 2 people\n            by spending 3 Progress or 3 people by spending 6 Progress, and so on.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Finally, some metrics specify a minimum value. For example, the metric “Range: 10X, minimum = 1 meter” means\n            the range starts 1 meter and is multiplied by 10 per point of Progress. This is often used to set the\n            minimum to a character statistic, for example “Size: 1 meter, minimum = Bonus” means the size starts at a\n            number of meters equal to the event’s Action Bonus and can be increased in 1 meter increments.\n          </p>\n        </Section>\n        <Section header=\"Improving Events\">\n          <p>\n            There is one event for each Entanglement, but the description there is the most basic and crude version of\n            the event. Each Entanglement will also have an esoteric Style that is full of specializations that allow you\n            to improve or customize the event. They can add new metrics, improve existing ones, or add new capabilities\n            entirely.\n          </p>\n        </Section>\n      </Section>\n      <Break page />\n    </Section>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Chapter5;\n","import { Fragment } from \"react\";\n\nconst EntanglementDescription = ({ intro = \"\", ranks = [] }) => {\n  return (\n    <Fragment>\n      {intro}\n      {ranks.map((rank, index) => (\n        <Fragment key={index}>\n          <h5 key={index} className=\"entanglementRank subheader\">\n            Rank {index + 1}\n          </h5>\n          {rank}\n        </Fragment>\n      ))}\n    </Fragment>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default EntanglementDescription;\n","import Break from \"../components/break/break\";\nimport Section from \"../components/section/section\";\nimport ChapterIntro from \"../components/chapter-intro/chapter-intro\";\nimport EntanglementDescription from \"../components/section/ent-desc\";\nimport Crosslink from \"../components/crosslink/crosslink\";\nimport Pair from \"../components/metabolism/pair\";\nimport { topics } from \"../context/rulebookContext\";\nimport Metabolism from \"../components/metabolism/metabolism\";\nimport Logomark from \"../svgs/logomark\";\n\nfunction Chapter6() {\n  return (\n    <Section coordinates={\"6\"} header=\"Entanglements\">\n      <ChapterIntro>\n        <p>\n          Each Entanglement contains several specializations sorted into two styles, one intuitive and one esoteric.\n        </p>\n        <Logomark />\n      </ChapterIntro>\n\n      <Section header=\"Intuitive Styles\" isChapterIntroColumn>\n        <p>\n          Intuitive Styles represent archetypal approaches to problem solving and are named with adjectives that\n          describe these approaches.
