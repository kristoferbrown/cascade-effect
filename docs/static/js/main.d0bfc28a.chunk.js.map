The GM presents a situation, and the players\n          say what their characters are doing. Most of the time, anything a player describes their character doing just\n          happens. However, if the action described is difficult for the character in some way, the GM will assign it a\n          <Crosslink target={topics.DIFFICULTY}>Difficulty</Crosslink> number and you will resolve a Challenge. The\n          basic details of resolving a challenge are presented here, for more details see chapter 3.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          To determine if you succeed, and at what cost, you must use your character's\n          <Crosslink target={topics.METABOLISM}>Metabolisms</Crosslink>\n          to attempt to beat the <Crosslink target={topics.DIFFICULTY}>Difficulty</Crosslink> number. For every\n          <Crosslink target={topics.CHALLENGE}>Challenge</Crosslink>, choose a pairing of one\n          <Crosslink target={topics.PHYS_METAB}>Physical Metabolism</Crosslink> and one\n          <Crosslink target={topics.HIDDEN_METAB}>Hidden Metabolism</Crosslink> that you will use to attempt to overcome\n          the\n          <Crosslink target={topics.DIFFICULTY}>Difficulty</Crosslink>.\n        </p>\n        <Section header=\"Comparing Difficulty\">\n          <p>\n            Often it is very simple to determine if you succeed. Add up the sum of the current values of your chosen\n            Metabolism pairing, this number is referred to as your Progress. If your Progress meets or exceeds the\n            Difficulty number then you complete the Challenge successfully.\n          </p>\n        </Section>\n        <Section header=\"Effort & Spending Metabolisms\">\n          <p>\n            Many <Crosslink target={topics.CHALLENGE}>Challenges</Crosslink> will have a set Effort value representing\n            how much physical or mental effort the Challenge requires. Some Effort values will require you to spend\n            Metabolism points. You spend these points by reducing the Current value of one or both of the involved\n            Metabolisms. These spent points can't be used again until they are regained, for example, by resting.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            When you spend Metabolism points, the amount of Progress created is equal to the number of points spent\n            instead of the sum of the current values.\n          </p>\n        </Section>\n        <Section header=\"Risk & Rolling Dice\">\n          <p>\n            Many <Crosslink target={topics.CHALLENGE}>Challenges</Crosslink> will have a set Risk value representing how\n            much chance, unpredictability, and things out of your character's control can influence the challenge.\n            Certain Risk values will require you to roll dice instead of just counting how successful you are.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            When a Challenge requires dice, the number of dice you roll is typically equal to how much Progress you\n            would have had without the dice. For example, if you would have gotten 4 Progress, instead roll 4 dice. Each\n            die you roll is a 6 sided die that has a roughly 50% chance of generating Progress.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Each die you roll that lands on 4 or above adds a point of\n            <Crosslink target={topics.PROGRESS}>Progress</Crosslink> to the results. Any die that comes up 6 gets\n            rerolled, potentially adding even more <Crosslink target={topics.PROGRESS}>Progress</Crosslink>, or even\n            coming up as 6 to reroll again.
