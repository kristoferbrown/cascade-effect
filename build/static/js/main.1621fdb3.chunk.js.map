For every\n          <Crosslink target={topics.CHALLENGE}>Challenge</Crosslink>, choose a pairing of one\n          <Crosslink target={topics.PHYS_METAB}>Physical Metabolism</Crosslink> and one\n          <Crosslink target={topics.HIDDEN_METAB}>Hidden Metabolism</Crosslink> that you will use to attempt to overcome the\n          <Crosslink target={topics.DIFFICULTY}>Difficulty</Crosslink>.\n        </p>\n        <Section header=\"Comparing Difficulty\">\n          <p>\n            Often it is very simple to determine if you succeed. Just compare the <Crosslink target={topics.DIFFICULTY}>Difficulty</Crosslink> number\n            to the sum of the current values of your chosen Metabolism pairing. If it meets or exceeds the difficulty then you complete the Challenge\n            successfully.\n          </p>\n        </Section>\n        <Section header=\"Spending Metabolisms\">\n          <p>\n            Most <Crosslink target={topics.CHALLENGE}>Challenge</Crosslink> require some physical or mental effort, and therefore require you to spend\n            1 point from either <Crosslink target={topics.METABOLISM}>Metabolism</Crosslink> in your chosen pair after counting your sum of your\n            pairing to determine success.

This causes all of your\n            Metabolisms to refill and lets you immediately spend any refilled points on the same challenge.

This material is not composed of atoms, but rather it is a single macroscopic hadron, a dense mass of many quarks bound\n                      together by the strong nuclear force.
