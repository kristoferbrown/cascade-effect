However, if the action described is difficult for the character in some way, the GM will assign it a\n          <Crosslink target={linkMap.DifficultyandContext}>Difficulty</Crosslink> number and you will resolve a\n          Challenge. The basic details of resolving a challenge are presented here, for more details see chapter 3.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          To determine if you succeed, and at what cost, you must use your character's\n          <Crosslink target={linkMap.Gameplay}>Metabolisms</Crosslink>\n          to attempt to beat the <Crosslink target={linkMap.DifficultyandContext}>Difficulty</Crosslink> number. For\n          every\n          <Crosslink target={linkMap.Challenges}>Challenge</Crosslink>, choose a pairing of one\n          <Crosslink target={linkMap.PhysicalMetabolisms}>Physical Metabolism</Crosslink> and one\n          <Crosslink target={linkMap.HiddenMetabolisms}>Hidden Metabolism</Crosslink> that you will use to attempt to\n          overcome the\n          <Crosslink target={linkMap.DifficultyandContext}>Difficulty</Crosslink>.\n        </p>\n        <Section header=\"Comparing Difficulty\">\n          <p>\n            Often it is very simple to determine if you succeed.

For example, a Trait called Medical Training\n            would be relevant in a<Crosslink target={linkMap.Challenges}>Challenge</Crosslink> about treating injuries.\n            Players and GMS are encouraged to be creative and flexible when deciding if Traits are relevant.\n          </p>\n        </Section>\n      </Section>\n\n      <Section header=\"Stress\">\n        <p>\n          Wear and tear accumulated from exertion and conflict is referred to as Stress.

When you take Stress, choose how to distribute the Stress between\n          all affected\n          <Crosslink target={linkMap.Gameplay}>Metabolisms</Crosslink>. Typically, the\n          <Crosslink target={linkMap.MetabolismPairing}>pair of Metabolisms</Crosslink> involved in the current\n          <Crosslink target={linkMap.Challenges}>Challenge</Crosslink> are the ones affected.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          For each point of Stress a <Crosslink target={linkMap.Gameplay}>Metabolism</Crosslink> takes, reduce its\n          maximum value by 1.

Cover that only blocks a small portion of your body has a value of 1,\n            blocking half of your body has a value of 3, and cover that blocks your entire body has a value of 6.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            When you are attacked, the incoming Threat is reduced by the value of the cover.

Each\n          Entanglement is associated with one cascade event its action bonus. You can only induce a cascade event if\n          your action bonus for it is above 0. The action bonus will be used to determine the maximum effectiveness of\n          the event.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Unless otherwise specified in the event’s description, inducing a cascade event is a full action and any\n          Challenges involved are default effort and low risk. Focus plus the Hidden Metabolism associated with the\n          event are required in any Challenges.\n        </p>\n        <Section header=\"Event Metrics\">\n          <p>\n            The amount of Progress needed to induce an event, and the strength of the event, are described by metrics.\n            Any Progress created when inducing the event is spent to increase these metrics. Each metric can be\n            increased by up to a maximum number of points equal to your Action Bonus for this event. For example, if\n            your action bonus for an event is 3 and the event has two different metrics, you could increase either\n            metric from 0 to 1, 2 or 3. If you increase both to 3 that typically would require 6 Progress to do.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Most metrics are a basic single unit. This unit indicates both how much the metric increases per point of\n            Progress you spend on it and also the minimum that occurs if you spend 0 Progress on it. For example, an\n            event with the metric “Duration: 1 minute” starts with a minimum duration of 1 minute when you spend 0\n            Progress on it, and increases by 1 minute for each point of Progress spent on it.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Some metrics indicate that they cost more than 1 point of Progress to increase them once. For example, the\n            metric “Targets: 1 person per 3” indicates that the event targets 1 person and can be increased to 2 people\n            by spending 3 Progress or 3 people by spending 6 Progress, and so on.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Finally, some metrics specify a minimum value. For example, the metric “Range: 10X, minimum = 1 meter” means\n            the range starts 1 meter and is multiplied by 10 per point of Progress. This is often used to set the\n            minimum to a character statistic, for example “Size: 1 meter, minimum = Bonus” means the size starts at a\n            number of meters equal to the event’s Action Bonus and can be increased in 1 meter increments.\n          </p>\n        </Section>\n        <Section header=\"Improving Events\">\n          <p>\n            There is one event for each Entanglement, but the description there is the most basic and crude version of\n            the event. Each Entanglement will also have an esoteric Style that is full of specializations that allow you\n            to improve or customize the event. They can add new metrics, improve existing ones, or add new capabilities\n            entirely.\n          </p>\n        </Section>\n      </Section>\n      <Break page />\n    </Section>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Chapter5;\n","import Crosslink from \"../crosslink/crosslink\";\n\nconst EventName = ({ name = \"\", linkTarget = \"\" }) => {\n  return (\n    <Crosslink target={linkTarget} className=\"eventName\">\n      {name}\n    </Crosslink>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default EventName;\n","import { Fragment } from \"react\";\nimport Metabolism from \"../metabolism/metabolism\";\nimport EventName from \"../section/event-name\";\n\nconst EntanglementDescription = ({\n  intro = \"\",\n  ranks = [],\n  rank3Met,\n  rank1Action,\n  rank1Event,\n  rank1EventTarget = \"\",\n}) => {\n  return (\n    <Fragment>\n      {intro}\n      {ranks.map((rankContent, index) => (\n        <Fragment key={index}>\n          <h5 key={index} className=\"entanglementRank subheader\">\n            Rank {index + 1}\n          </h5>\n          {index === 0 && rank1Action ? <p>{`Your ${rank1Action} action bonus increases by 1.`}</p> : null}\n          {index === 0 && rank1Event ?
